To run the application, run the commands:

    //Cleans the the workspace of all build output. Not Necessary first time running.
    ./gradlew clean

    //Builds a .war file and places it into the build/lib folder
    ./gradlew war

Take this war and copy it into a tomcat7 webapps folder. You may want to rename the
war file to something shorter.
